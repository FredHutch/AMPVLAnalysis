AMP PK Modeling
=================


Using the fully-adjusted case-control model to fix the population parameters: refit the model to extract the individual parameters and generate fine-grid concentration curves for analysis and for the PKPD modeling.

This model is fit using the full case-control cohort noting only half are cases in the viral load analysis.
