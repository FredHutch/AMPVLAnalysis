AMP PK Modeling
=================

Using the fully-adjusted case-control model to fix the population parameters: refit the model to extract the individual parameters and generate fine-grid concentration curves for analysis and for the PKPD modeling.

This model is fit using the full case-control cohort noting only half are cases in the viral load analysis.

Many participants received infusions after first positive, the goal of this analysis is to generate the pre-infection 
PK (parameters and first positive/exposure concentrations). NOT to incorporate the post-infection infusions, which will be directly used in the PKPD analysis.
